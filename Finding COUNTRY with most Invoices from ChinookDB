##  Alright, now that you're warmed up let's get down to business!

##  In this problem set we'll pretend the Chinook database is the data for your own personal music shop!

##  highest number of invoices.

QUERY ='''
SELECT Billingcountry, COUNT(*) AS numberofinvoices
FROM Invoice
GROUP BY BIllingcountry
ORDER BY numberofinvoices desc
